<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    In this graphic an increase is evident in my house, due to the fact that in
    my house there is an increase in energy every month.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The relationship between the points of the linear regression and the points
    of my data is that the regression line is intended to approach the points of
    my data showing the trend that these acquire, as if it were an average, in
    this case increasing over the months.
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  $$ 7.00 \cdot 6 + 119.00 $$ $$ y= 161 $$
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    From what the graphs have shown me, the consume in my house is a viable and
    stable, since it is the average that 3 people living together can generate,
    but clearly it is necessary to make a good use of electricity to avoid
    wasting it,for example, not leaving lights on when they are not needed or
    having too many lights on in unnecessary spaces.
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    This graph is based on a survey that shows the number of people living in a
    house and how much is their consumed per month, in which an increase is
    observed, because the less people living in a house, the less their
    consumption would be, while if many people live in a house, consumption
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    In this graph it is evident that the more people live there is a greater
    increase of energy and if they live more few this decreases, as mentioned
    above. Clearly the graph generates an increase because of these two
    variables (how many people live in the house and how much they generate)
    that make this difference in all the data provided, because there are very
    different data per house.
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  $$ 50.81 \cdot 200 + 1.26 $$ $$ y= 10163.26 $$
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    Although the graph shows very similar and very different data, it shows an
    increasing graph, this is due to the fact that the graph takes these data as
    an average and most of them present an increase depending on the variables
    provided by each house in the survey.
  </p>
</ul>
