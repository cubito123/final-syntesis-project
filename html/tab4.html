    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
    </p>
    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
           <p> According to the graphs, it can be seen that during the last five months at
    home there has been a tendency to increase energy expenditure. </p>
            <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
            <p> The relationship between them is that the linear regression is presenting an average with respect to the red dots due to their behavior and it is doing so in a parallel order to them, demonstrating that as time passes, in general, it tends to increase.</p>

            <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
            <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li>
            <p> As time goes by, the needs and the number of times we spend electricity according to the results given by the graph increase, so we must look for methods and replace those household objects that increase the amount of energy used for example to turn on the light only when necessary and disconnect electronic devices when they are no longer necessary depending on each situation. </p>
          </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
         <p>It can be seen from the information in the graph that during 
           the last five months the ten people surveyed have shown an increase 
           in energy expenditure, even though most of them do not show very large differences.
          </p>
         <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
         <p>The relationship between the linear regression and the colors
            is that it shows in a general way the results and average that 
            are found between the increases of the energy expenditure of the 
            people who are being analyzed taking as reference the color points, 
            although some are in low points when analyzing the graph we conclude 
            that most of them have a tendency to increase.
          </p>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         $$ 12.00 cdot 200 +  226.80 $$ $$ y= 2626.8 $$
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
            between these two variables.</li>
            <p>The relationship that I find between these two variables is that through the graph they provide information about the results given in this case by a linear regression survey and the scores are strongly linked because while one provides concrete and specific information the other takes all this and draws a general average, as for example in this case the graph provides information that in most cases there was a tendency to increase.</p>
