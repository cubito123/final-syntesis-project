<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Electric energy</li>
  <p>
    This contact causes an electrical current that consists of the transmission
    of negative charges (electrons) through a suitable material (such as metals)
    from the point of generation (and/or storage) to the point of consumption.
    Usually electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy: light,
    mechanical or thermal.

  <li>Watt (physical unit)</li>
  <p>
    The watt (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard
    unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second.
    The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy
    isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated,
    absorbed, or dissipated.

  <li>Scatter plot</li>
  <p>
    A scatter plot is a set of points plotted on a horizontal and vertical axes.
    Scatter plots are important in statistics because they can show the extent
    of correlation, if any, between the values of observed quantities or
    phenomena (called variables).

  <li>Linear regression</li>
  <p>
    Linear regression is a data analysis technique that predicts the value of
    unknown data by using another related and known data value. It
    mathematically models the unknown or dependent variable and the known or
    independent variable as a linear equation.

  <li>Renewable energy</li>
  <p>
    Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished
    at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are
    such sources that are constantly being replenished.
