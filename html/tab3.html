<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    In this graph it is possible to show an increase in the level of energy used
    in my house
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The red dots indicate the exact number of energy expenditures in my house
    and the sequence of gray dots helps me to identify the linear regression,
    which is used to predict the value of a variable according to the value of
    another variable.
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>
    $$ y = 1.90\cdot 6 + 128.10 $$ $$ = 139.5$$
  </p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    in conclusion I feel that in my house we should start practicing ways of
    energy reduction for example: Unplugging devices that are not in use,
    Reducing the use of electrical appliances, Choosing more energy efficient
    appliances, Remembering to turn off lights, etc. this would help to lower
    consumption statistics.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    Within the surveyed colleagues it can be identified that although they have
    different statistics and number of residents of consumption, it continues to
    generate an increase in energy expenditure.
  </p>

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The red dots indicate the exact number of energy expenditures at the
    respondents' properties and the sequence of gray dots helps me to identify
    the linear regression used to predict the value of one variable based on the
    value of another variable. another variable.
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>
    $$ y = 51.63\cdot 200 + -29.50 $$ $$ = 10296.5 $$
  </p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
